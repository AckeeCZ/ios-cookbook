# Releases

We release often so we prepared several steps you have to follow

1. Make sure your changes were merged from `development` branch to  `master` branch ❗️
2. Make sure your changes went through code review 🔎
3. Make sure your tester has blisters on his / her hands from exhausting user/monkey testing 🖐
4. Create tag for version in `master`branch ✔️ 
5. Run `fastlane appstore` 🤓
6. Go celebrate! 🎉
5. Seriously thats all, we ♥ ️our CI.

In case you want to be extra careful or you are just suspicious you can check HockeyApp and iTunes connect if builds were uploaded successfully.

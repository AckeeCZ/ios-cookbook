If you came here for some Ackee and salt fish recipes then I have bad news for you. We cook mobile & web apps and this CookBook is about cooking the best apps with Prague based company Ackee. 

However if you really want same Ackee and saltfish instead of swift here are some [recipes][1] for you :)

#### Why another swift practices / style guide?

There could be many similar cookbooks but this one is ours and we want to share for several reasons
- We hire a lot! So you know what you can expect joining us
- We think we do some pretty cool stuff and we want to share it with you 
- *Sharing is caring*
- Besides who wouldn’t like to have own cookbook on the internet right?
